# EMPLOYEE TURNOVER PREDICITON
Employee turnover is one of the most significant problems an organization can encounter throughout its lifecycle, as it is difficult to predict and often introduces noticeable voids in an organizationâ€™s skilled workforce. Service firms recognize that the timely delivery of their services can become compromised, overall firm productivity can decrease significantly and, consequently, customer loyalty can decline when employees leave unexpectedly. As a result, it is imperative that organizations formulate proper recruitment, acquisition and retention strategies and implement effective mechanisms to prevent and diminish employee turnover, while understanding its underlying, root causes.
